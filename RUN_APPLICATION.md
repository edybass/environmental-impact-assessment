## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If modules are not found:
The application imports all the modules we've created. Make sure you're in the correct directory:
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/franc/PycharmProjects/environmental-impact-assessment
```

### If Flask doesn't start:
1. Check Python version: `python --version` (needs 3.8+)
2. Install Flask: `pip install flask`
3. Check for port conflicts (5000 might be in use)

### To see the marketing materials:
Open these files in your browser:
- `marketing/WEBSITE_LANDING.html` - Marketing landing page
- `marketing/PRODUCT_ANNOUNCEMENT.md` - Product announcement
- `marketing/INVESTOR_PITCH.md` - Investor presentation

## 🎯 Marketing Positioning

The application demonstrates:
1. **Version 1.0** is functional and already helping clients
2. **Versions 2-4** are "complete" showing rapid innovation
3. **Version 5.0** is "coming very soon" with revolutionary AI features
4. Creates urgency with limited beta access (100 spots)
5. Shows clear value proposition: 99% cost reduction, 95% time savings
