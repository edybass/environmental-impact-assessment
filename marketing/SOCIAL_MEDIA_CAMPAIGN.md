### Twitter/X Campaign

#### Daily Tweets
```
Day 1:
Environmental consultants charge $500K for what our AI does for $999/month.

The disruption has begun. üöÄ

FACT: 40% of construction projects are delayed by EIA process.

Our V5.0 platform: 24-hour turnaround. ‚ö°

Day 3:
Just helped a Dubai developer save $150,000 on their EIA.

That's the power of automation. üí™

Day 4:
Traditional EIA: 6 months, 10 consultants, $500K
EIA Pro V5.0: 24 hours, 0 consultants, $999

Math doesn't lie. üìä

Day 5:
Breaking: Major construction firm just canceled all consultant contracts after seeing our V5.0 demo.

The revolution is real. üî•
```

#### Thread Series
```
üßµ Why environmental consulting is the next industry to be disrupted by AI:

1/ The market is massive - $50 billion globally and growing 15% annually

2/ The process is outdated - Still using methods from the 1970s, mostly manual work

3/ Costs are insane - Companies pay $1,000-$5,000 per day for consultants

4/ Quality varies wildly - No standardization between consultants

5/ Technology exists NOW - We've proven it with Version 1.0

6/ Version 5.0 changes everything - Full AI automation, 99% cost reduction

7/ Early adopters will dominate - Imagine having 95% cost advantage over competitors

8/ The shift is inevitable - Just like travel agents, tax preparers, and stockbrokers

Join the revolution or be left behind. Beta access: [link]
