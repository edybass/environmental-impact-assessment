# 🎯 How to See Your Complete EIA Platform in Action

## ✅ Your docs/index.html is NOW Updated!

I've just updated your `docs/index.html` file to connect with all the backend modules. Here's exactly how to see everything working:

## 🚀 Step 1: Start the Backend Server

**Option A - Simple Server (No dependencies needed):**
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/franc/PycharmProjects/environmental-impact-assessment
python3 simple_server.py
```

**Option B - Advanced Server (If you have Flask):**
```bash
python3 integrated_backend.py
```

## 🌐 Step 2: Open Your Application

Once the server starts, open your browser and go to:
**http://localhost:5000**

You'll see your **enhanced** `docs/index.html` with:
- All your original design preserved
- Version 1.0 vs 5.0 marketing banners
- Beta signup form
- Live statistics

## 🎯 Step 3: Test the Integration

1. **Fill out the 4-step assessment wizard**:
   - Step 1: Project Information
   - Step 2: Environmental Screening  
   - Step 3: Impact Analysis
   - Step 4: Results & Reports

2. **When you click "Analyze Impacts"**, the page will:
   - Call the backend API (`/api/assess-project`)
   - Run all 50+ Python modules
   - Display advanced results including:
     - Air Dispersion Modeling results
     - Noise Propagation calculations
