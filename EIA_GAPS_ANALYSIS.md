  - Resident and migratory species
  - Breeding and nesting areas
  - Wildlife corridors and movement patterns
  - Protected species under local law

### Ecosystem Assessment:
- **Habitat Mapping**
  - Critical habitats identification
  - Ecosystem services valuation
  - Ecological connectivity
  - Cumulative impacts on ecosystems

## 4. üèîÔ∏è **SOIL & GEOLOGY** (Critical Gap)

### Soil Assessment:
- **Soil Quality**
  - Contamination assessment
  - Erosion potential and control
  - Soil suitability for construction
  - Agricultural land impacts

### Geological Assessment:
- **Ground Stability**
  - Seismic hazard assessment
  - Slope stability analysis
  - Subsidence potential
  - Foundation suitability

## 5. üë• **SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT** (Major Gap)

### Demographics:
- **Population Impact**
  - Population increase during construction/operation
  - Housing demand and availability
  - Infrastructure capacity (schools, hospitals)

### Cultural Heritage:
- **Archaeological Assessment**
  - Archaeological site identification
  - Cultural heritage preservation
  - Traditional land use impacts

### Traffic & Transportation:
- **Traffic Impact Assessment**
  - Construction traffic (heavy vehicles)
  - Operational traffic generation
  - Road capacity and level of service
  - Public transport impacts

### Health & Safety:
- **Public Health Assessment**
  - Health risk assessment
  - Emergency response planning
  - Community safety measures

## 6. ‚ö†Ô∏è **RISK ASSESSMENT** (Critical Gap)

### Environmental Risks:
- **Hazard Identification**
  - Chemical spills and releases
  - Fire and explosion risks
  - Natural disaster vulnerability
  - Climate change impacts

### Risk Management:
- **Emergency Response**
  - Emergency response plans
  - Evacuation procedures
  - Communication protocols
  - Recovery planning

## 7. üìã **REGULATORY COMPLIANCE** (Incomplete)

### UAE Specific:
- **Federal Law No. 24 of 1999**
- **Cabinet Resolution No. 37 of 2001**
- **Local municipality requirements** (Dubai, Abu Dhabi, etc.)
- **ADEK, RERA, other authority requirements**

### KSA Specific:
- **Environmental Law**
- **NCEC Guidelines**
- **Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture**
- **Municipal regulations**

## 8. üìä **ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN** (Missing)

### Mitigation Measures:
- **Impact-specific mitigation**
- **Implementation timeline**
- **Responsible parties**
- **Performance indicators**

### Monitoring Program:
- **Parameter-specific monitoring**
- **Monitoring locations and frequency**
- **Reporting requirements**
- **Corrective actions**

---

## üö® **BOTTOM LINE:**
**Our current platform covers ~15% of what's needed for regulatory compliance in UAE/KSA**

### **Priority Order for Development:**
1. **Waste Management** (Regulatory requirement)
2. **Water Resources** (Critical for UAE/KSA)
3. **Biological Assessment** (Environmental clearance)
4. **Regulatory Compliance** (UAE/KSA specific)
5. **Risk Assessment** (Health & safety)
6. **Socio-Economic** (Community impact)
7. **Environmental Management Plan** (Implementation)

**We need to build these modules to have a truly professional EIA platform.**
