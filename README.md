## 💡 Usage Examples

### Basic Environmental Screening

```python
from src.assessment import EIAScreening

# Initialize screening tool
screening = EIAScreening(project_type="construction", location="Dubai")

# Run initial assessment
results = screening.assess({
    "project_size": 50000,  # m²
    "duration": 24,  # months
    "sensitive_receptors": ["school", "hospital"],
    "water_usage": 1000  # m³/day
})

print(f"EIA Required: {results.eia_required}")
print(f"Key Concerns: {results.key_concerns}")
```

### Construction Impact Analysis

```python
from src.analysis import ConstructionImpact

# Analyze construction impacts
impact = ConstructionImpact()

# Noise assessment
noise_results = impact.assess_noise(
    equipment=["excavator", "pile_driver", "concrete_mixer"],
    working_hours="07:00-19:00",
    nearest_receptor_distance=50  # meters
)

# Dust assessment
dust_results = impact.assess_dust(
    soil_type="sandy",
    moisture_content=5,  # %
    wind_speed=15,  # km/h
    mitigation_measures=["water_spraying", "barriers"]
)
```

### Compliance Checking

```python
from src.compliance import UAECompliance, KSACompliance

# Check UAE compliance
uae_checker = UAECompliance()
compliance = uae_checker.check_all(project_data)

if not compliance.is_compliant:
    print("Non-compliance issues:")
    for issue in compliance.issues:
        print(f"- {issue.regulation}: {issue.description}")
```
